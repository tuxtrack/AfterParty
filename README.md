# AfterParty

This project is a fork of InspectAssembly, created by Matt Hand, aka @MatterPreter
 
This project inspects targets (.exe's and dll's) .NET assembly's CIL for calls to deserializers and checks if .NET remoting is being used to aid in finding potential privilege escalations or other security bugs on the host.
